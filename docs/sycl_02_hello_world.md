# Parallelism in Modern C++; from CPU to GPU
### Exercise 2: Hello World

---

In this first exercise you will learn:
* How to create and submit a command group.
* How to define a SYCL kernel function.
* How to stream output from a SYCL kernel function.

---

Once you have a queue you can now submit work for the device to be executed, and this is done via command groups, which are made up of commands and data dependencies.

1.) Define a command group

Define a lambda to represent your command group and pass it to the submit member function of the queue.

Note that submitting a command group without any commands will result in an error.

2.) Define a SYCL kernel function

Define a SYCL kernel function via the `single_task` command within the command group, which takes only a function object which itself doesn't take any parameters.

Remember to declare a class for your kernel name in the global namespace.

3.) Stream “Hello World!” to stdout from the SYCL kernel function

Create a `stream` object within the command group scope as follows. The two parameters to the constructor of the `stream` class are the total buffer size and the statement size respectively.

Then use the stream you constructed within the SYCL kernel function to print “Hello world!” using the `<<` operator.

4.) Try another command

Instead of `single_task` try another command for defining a SYCL kernel function (see [SYCL 1.2.1 specification][sycl-specification], sec 4.8.5).

Remember the function object for the `parallel_for` which takes a `range` can be an `id` or an `item` and the function object for the `parallel_for` which takes an `nd_range` must be an `nd_item`.

5.) Try a different dimensionality

Instead of a 1-dimensional range for your SYCL kernel function, try a 2 or 3-dimensional range.
