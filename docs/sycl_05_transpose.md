# Parallelism in Modern C++; from CPU to GPU
### Exercise 5: Transpose

---

In this first exercise you will learn:
* How to create a simple matrix transpose kernel.
* How to allocate and use local memory.
* How to synchronize work-groups.
* How different work-group sizes effect performance.

---

TODO

1.) Write a SYCL kernel for transposing matrices.

2.) Use local memory to improve global memory coalescing.

3.) Try different work-group sizes.
